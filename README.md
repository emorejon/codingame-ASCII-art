ASCII art puzzle from codingame.com

In this exercize, we are given two integers (width and heigth) a String and an A to Z plus ? representation in ASCII art.
We are to take the String given and display the corresponding ASCII art representation to screen. Each letter should be of the 
width and height specified.

I commented the code so it's easier to follow.

Cheers.
